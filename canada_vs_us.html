<h1>Canada or USA?</h1>
<h2>Which country is better to call home?</h2>
	<p>Canada sits right above the United States, making up a big part of North America. The countries are so close, in fact, that in some of the northern states, Canada is only a short drive away. This can make it easy to assume that Canada and America are the same but that couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
	<p>Between politics, religion, currency, and food, there are lots of differences between the two countries. </p>
