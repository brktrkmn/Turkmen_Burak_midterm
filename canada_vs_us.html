<h1>Canada or USA?</h1>
<h2>Which country is better to call home?</h2>
	<p>Canada sits right above the United States, making up a big part of North America. The countries are so close, in fact, that in some of the northern states, Canada is only a short drive away. This can make it easy to assume that Canada and America are the same but that couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
	<p>Between politics, religion, currency, and food, there are lots of differences between the two countries. </p>

<h1>Canada is the best!</h1>

<p>Most of the rest of the world (and America) looks at Canada as the weaker, more polite North American cousin. We've even gotten pretty good at playing the second fiddle over the years. But that doesn't mean we don't sneak up from time to time like Donovan Bailey and claim a few victories over our Yankee neighbours. Here are 20 ranked reasons why Canada is way better than the United States, all selected by a true Canadian. Oh, and none of them have to do with hockey.</p>

<h3>We don't wear our shoes in the house</h3>
<p>Entering a US household is a lot like a pachyderm pen at the zoo. To Canadians, it just seems wrong to wear your outside shoes inside. Score one for Canadian cleanliness.</p>
<h3>Canada's WAY safer</h3>
<p>Statistics place the US murder-per-capita rate at about five times that of Canada’s. And that’s just looking at one statistic (albeit, the most important one). Plus we have the best health care system (more on that later).</p>
<h3>We use the Metric System</h3>
<p>In Canada, life is way easier because most day-to-day math equations can be solved by understanding the power of 10. Oh, you need a ridiculously complicated conversion chart to bake a cake, America? That’s too bad.</p>
<h3>We invented the Wonderbra</h3>
<p>Revolutionizing women's underwear and paving the way for Victoria's Secret is the crown jewel of reasons why Canada is better than the US We were light years ahead on the Wonderbra and we demand recognition. Well, not really demand, because we're also very polite. Sorry for calling you barbarians.</p>
